    <p class="mb-3">
        According to AKC's published breed standard which was approved June 10, 1936,
         the "American Staffordshire Terrier should give the impression of great strength for his size,
          a well put-together dog, muscular, but agile and graceful, keenly alive to his surroundings.
           He should be stocky, not long-legged or racy in outline. His courage is proverbial." His head should be medium in length with a broad skull,
            a distinct stop, and pronounced muscles in the cheek. The ears should be set high on their head and can be cropped or uncropped,
             but the latter is preferred. Height and weight should be in proportion. A height of about 18 to 19 inches (46 to 48 cm)
              at shoulders for the male and 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46 cm) for the female is to be considered preferable.
              The nose should always be black. Many coat colors are accepted. However, dogs with liver or black-and-tan coat, and dogs with more
               than 80% white are discouraged.
